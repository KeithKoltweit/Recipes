            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F</li>
                <li>In a medium skillet over medium heat, add the diced onion and the garlic and cook until the
                    onion is
                    translucent. Remove from the heat and cool slightly.</li>
                <li>In a bowl combine the ground chicken, egg white, tomato paste, basil, chopped fresh spinach,
                    parsley,
                    onion and garlic in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper and mix well. Form meatballs and
                    roll into
                    little balls, about 1 tablespoon of mixture per ball. Place the formed meatballs into a large
                    baking pan
                    about one inch apart.</li>
                <li>Combine 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1/2 cup of tomato sauce together in a small bowl and brush
                    on top
                    of each meatball. Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Top with fresh spinach leaves.

            <ol>
                <li>Add chicken to a bowl and dress with 1/4 pesto and juice of 3 lemons.
                    Marinate in the refrigerator for 20 minutes or up to 1 hour</li>
                <li>Preheat grill to medium-high.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, chop basil and scallions and set aside.</li>
                <li>Oil the grill rack. Remove the chicken from the marinade and grill until
                    cooked through and no longer pink in the middle, about 2 minutes per side.
                    Serve the chicken with pesto and add chopped basil and scallions for garnish.</li>
